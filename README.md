# Automatic Weight Painter Blender Addon
Final project code for my Computer Science Degree. Attaches the selected skeleton rig to the desired 3D model using proximity based weighting.
Comes with a user friendly interface that comes with a plethora of settings. The interface comes with controls such as changing the proximity radius and the proximity volume shape.
